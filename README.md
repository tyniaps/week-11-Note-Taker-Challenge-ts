Introduction to Express.js

## Description

The Note Taker Challenge was completed while further exploring Node.js, with particular focus on the Express.js framework. 

Completing this project allowed for a deeper understanding of the Request-Response model and the methods needed to ensure that requests and responses are correctly handled. 

Some key learning topics include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, CRUD methods and the use of Insomnia to test routes.
